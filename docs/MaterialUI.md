# Material UI


## MUI system

### Grid
> _Responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts._\
> _Material Design's responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout._

#### Default breakpoints
> _Each breakpoint (a key) matches with a fixed screen width (a value):_
- **xs**, extra-small: 0px
- **sm**, small: 600px
-  **md**, medium: 900px
- **lg**, large: 1200px
- **xl**, extra-large: 1536px

#### Fluid grids
+ Components may have multiple widths defined, causing the layout to change at the defined breakpoint. 
+ Width values given to larger breakpoints override those given to smaller breakpoints.
+ The rowSpacing and columnSpacing props allow for specifying the row and column gaps independently.


### Stack
> _It is a container component for arranging elements vertically or horizontally._\
> _Stack is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is preferable when you need both vertical and horizontal arrangement._
