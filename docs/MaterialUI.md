# Material UI

To support the **App Router**, the components and hooks from **Base UI** that need access to browser APIs are exported with the `"use client"` directive.

## Layout MUI system
> _Stack is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is preferable when you need both vertical and horizontal arrangement._

### Grid
> _Responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts._\
> _Material Design's responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout._

* docs:
* code:

#### Default breakpoints
> _Each breakpoint (a key) matches with a fixed screen width (a value):_
- **xs**, extra-small: 0px
- **sm**, small: 600px
-  **md**, medium: 900px
- **lg**, large: 1200px
- **xl**, extra-large: 1536px

#### Fluid grids
+ Components may have multiple widths defined, causing the layout to change at the defined breakpoint. 
+ Width values given to larger breakpoints override those given to smaller breakpoints.
+ The rowSpacing and columnSpacing props allow for specifying the row and column gaps independently.


### Stack
> _It is a container component for arranging elements vertically or horizontally._\
> _Stack is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is preferable when you need both vertical and horizontal arrangement._

* docs: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-stack/
* code: `import Stack from '@mui/material/Stack';`

#### [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)

2,100+ ready-to-use React Material Icons from the official website.\
``npm install @mui/icons-material``

Each Material icon also has a "theme":
+ **Filled** theme (default) is exported as @mui/icons-material/Delete,
+ **Outlined** theme is exported as @mui/icons-material/DeleteOutlined,
+ **Rounded** theme is exported as @mui/icons-material/DeleteRounded,
+ **Twotone** theme is exported as @mui/icons-material/DeleteTwoTone,
+ **Sharp** theme is exported as @mui/icons-material/DeleteSharp.


### Drawer
The navigation drawers (or "sidebars") provide ergonomic access to destinations in a site or app functionality such as switching accounts.
A navigation drawer can either be permanently on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon.

* docs: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/
* code:

[Side sheets](https://m2.material.io/components/sheets-side) are supplementary surfaces primarily used on tablet and desktop.

Modal side sheets are used on mobile instead of standard side sheets, due to limited screen size.
They can display the same types of content as standard side sheets, but must be dismissed in order to interact with the underlying content.

Side sheets should be placed on the opposite side of a side navigation drawer to avoid obstructing the UI or causing confusion about the sheetâ€™s functionality.
